BlindLine is an innovative education system for the visually impaired. It works as a wearable ring that can assist in the process of learning the Braille language. 

How the system works is that it is a 3D printed ring like device that hold Raspberry Pi Zero that has both a speaker and camera built into it. With a click of a button, this device will capture a photo of what it is pointed at (Braille) and then proceed to play the corresponding pronunciation for it.
